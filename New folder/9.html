<h1><i>IMPORTANCE OF GALLERY</i></h1>
<HR></HR>
  <b>Art galleries are an important part of the arts. That’s why they exist. They give artists a professional platform to showcase and sell their artwork. They offer artists the chance to reach a new clientele which often includes collectors of the arts. Art is meant to be seen in person. It is meant to be displayed so you can take time to “be” with the artwork and feel it. Online will never be able to that the same way.


Art Galleries also give you more time to create. The gallery does all the promotion for opening events from print to online. The gallery hosts opening receptions and special events giving the public the chance to meet and mingle with artists. Connecting to someone in person is much more valuable than sending a DM. The gallery handles the sales of your artwork and then sends you a payment. They handle and shipping and delivery if needed. They are helping your run your art business. Starting to make more sense how valuable they are? Well I’m not done yet. Besides exhibition offerings you now have a reputable space you have shown your work and can add to your resume. Building your resume is so important to show you are a working and an exhibiting artist. This adds value to you as an artist.


Some galleries, such as the Artless Bastard go a step further. We offer workshops taught by local artists to the community such as drawing courses, painting classes, Polaroid transfers and more. We also believe in helping to educate artists on how to run their business better. These free resources include a podcast, in person artist meetings, and weekly live posts. All meant to guide them in being more successful.


So I hope that if you are one of the people who have a bitter and negative outlook for a bad experience or you are simply making judgments based on what others say that you step out of that and see how important the arts are to everyone. We need art to be accessible and available to everyone. We need more spaces that share and showcase original artwork from all levels of artists. We need art. We need to work together to grow and succeed. You are not alone and know that there are resources out there that want to help you. Be kind and keep making art!
